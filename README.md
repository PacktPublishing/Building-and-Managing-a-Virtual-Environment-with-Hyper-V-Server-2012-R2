# Building and Managing a Virtual Environment with Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Building and Managing a Virtual Environment with Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/building-and-managing-virtual-environment-hyper-v-server-2012-r2-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781782176985), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The blend of Hyper-V and failover clustering provides strong resilience to your organization's critical applications and services. Where Hyper-V provides hardware abstraction, system consolidation, rapid deployment, and simple portability on one hand, failover clustering adds features such as rapid, automated failure handling and downtime-free maintenance for hardware.

Building and Managing a Virtual Environment with Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 is a video series designed to present the complexities of Hyper-V and failover cluster configuration in easily digestible chunks. The segments feature demonstrations of the concepts explained in the video, being executed on an actual Hyper-V cluster.

You'll begin with the basics of setting up your nodes, gathering them into the cluster, and working with your shared storage system. Then you'll get an in-depth tour of managing your systems using the built-in graphical tools and PowerShell cmdlets. With that foundation, you'll learn advanced concepts of virtual machine migration and cluster protection. You'll also discover detailed maintenance steps, such as how Cluster-Aware Updating keeps your nodes patched without impacting virtual machines.

Building and Managing a Virtual Environment with Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 will present you with the knowledge and examples you need to successfully design and deploy your own Hyper-V clusters.
